### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - TikTok: What is the app and how much data does it collect?

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Tidy, Joe. August 3, 2020. BBC NEWS. "TikTok: What is the app and how much data does it collect?". https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53476117

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article discusses what the app TikTok is, why it is so popular, and what the concerns are about the data that it collects.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern is that the app collects (seemingly) too much unnecessary data. Another further concern was that because the app is Chinese, that the Chinese government will have access to all of this data.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Which videos are watched and commented on, location data, phone model and operating system used, the keystroke rhythms people exhibit when they type along with the copy-and-paste clipboards of users.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The location data is being used to show users content from other creators in their area, the videos watched and commented on (interaction) to determine which content users like and to generate similar content, the phone model and operating system for the version of the app and integration with a user's software, and the keystroke patterns for commenting purposes.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Companies who buy user's data have something to gain (China could also use it as a form of propaganda, according to the article) and users have something to lose from this form of analysis.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - "Has Google's Data Collection Gone Too Far?"

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Da Silva, Michael. November 7, 2019. DW. "Has Google's Data Collection Gone Too Far?". https://www.dw.com/en/has-googles-data-collection-gone-too-far/a-49531478

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Google collects an absurd about of seemingly unnecessary data and does quite a lot with it.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - Google is selling its users' data and has not always been transparent about what it does with the data.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Location data, personal data (marital status), web browser history, and so much more.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The analysis, as I understand it, is that Google analyzes what they need to and then sell what they can.  

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Google stands to profit, companies that buy and use user data stand to gain something, and the user loses from this form of analysis.
